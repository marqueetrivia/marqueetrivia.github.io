We&#8217;ll be looking back at 2019, so now&#8217;s the time to start brushing up on box office stats or double check how many movies Keanu Reeves was in (it&#8217;s more than the two you&#8217;re thinking of). Doors will be at 7pm and questions will start at 7:30. We recommend getting there early to get a good table.</p>\n<p><strong>See you at trivia!</strong></p>\n<p><em>This event is being co-presented by The Brattle Theatre. The winning team will receive a prize from the theatre.</em></p>\n","location":{"address":"116 Brighton Ave, Boston, MA 02134, USA"},"googleCalendarLink":"https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NjQ5M2loNGU3MGYzMTRmazZiamVldTVyZWwgbWFycXVlZXRyaXZpYS5jb21fdnE2cHJoaW5iM2VsMG1mY2xtdDBqdWY1MmdAZw&tmsrc=marqueetrivia.com_vq6prhinb3el0mfclmt0juf52g%40group.calendar.google.com","icalAsset":"January2020.ics","photoAsset":"/january2020/january2020-hero.jpg"}}},"context":{}}
