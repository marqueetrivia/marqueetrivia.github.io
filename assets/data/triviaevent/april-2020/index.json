To join this first edition, we’re asking for a suggested donation of $6 (or more!), and we’ll be donating all of the net proceeds to help support our friends at the Brattle Theatre while they’re closed down.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This online trivia night will be run through Zoom. Click the button to head to PayPal, select a giving level, and then you will be redirected to the Zoom page to register. Note: do not exit out of the PayPal page! It will take a minute to redirect, please be patient.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"button-container\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&#038;hosted_button_id=U9S6FAZGL56X4&#038;source=url\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"button\" style=\"color: white;\">Register For Trivia</a>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>How will this work?</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Setup</h3>\n<p>Every team member must register here before the start of the trivia night! You’ll get a personalized Zoom link emailed to you. Make sure you’ve downloaded and set up Zoom prior to the start time.</p>\n<p>Teams are responsible for setting up communication between members on their own. You can do a group chat, a Google hangout, or even all be together in the same room—as long as you’re being safe!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>We’ll be broadcasting to you live, and running through seven rounds of questions as usual! You’ll be submitting your answers through different Google Form links, which will be supplied to you at the start of each round. Make sure you have a stable internet connection, because we’ll be sharing clips and audio as well.</p>\n","location":{"address":""},"googleCalendarLink":"https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=N3YxYWY5a3VmOHRkZW0xZXFzcnNzY3J1a2QgbWFycXVlZXRyaXZpYS5jb21fdnE2cHJoaW5iM2VsMG1mY2xtdDBqdWY1MmdAZw&tmsrc=marqueetrivia.com_vq6prhinb3el0mfclmt0juf52g%40group.calendar.google.com","photoAsset":"/april2020/april2020.png"}}},"context":{}}
