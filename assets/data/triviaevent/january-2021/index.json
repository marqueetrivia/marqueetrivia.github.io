Join us on Tuesday, January 12 at 7:30pm for another virtual trivia night, as we look back on the total mess of a year that 2020 was.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This online trivia night will be run through Zoom. Click the button to head to PayPal, purchase a pass, and then you will be redirected to the Zoom page to register. Note: do not exit out of the PayPal page!

Registration is $6 per person, and you&#8217;ll get a personalized Zoom link emailed to you. Make sure you&#8217;ve downloaded and set up Zoom prior to the start time.</p>\n<p>Teams are responsible for setting up communication between members on their own. You can do a group text, a Google hangout, or even all be together in the same room—as long as you&#8217;re being safe!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ll be broadcasting to you live, and running through seven rounds of questions as usual! The Zoom will open at 7:15pm, and trivia will start promptly at 7:30pm.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll be submitting your answers through different Google Form links, which will be supplied to you at the start of each round. Every team will need to select one captain, who will be in charge of submitting the answers each round.</p>\n<p>While we can&#8217;t safely let the winners come in person to pick from the famous grab bag, the winning team will get a choice between three mystery prize packs over Zoom, with delivery afterwards!</p>\n","location":{"address":""},"googleCalendarLink":"https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=M2dwYXUzMzQ1a2lvb3VmdXQwdHV2bWRlNmwgbWFycXVlZXRyaXZpYS5jb21fdnE2cHJoaW5iM2VsMG1mY2xtdDBqdWY1MmdAZw&tmsrc=marqueetrivia.com_vq6prhinb3el0mfclmt0juf52g%40group.calendar.google.com","photoAsset":"/january2021/january2021-hero.png"}}},"context":{}}
